			<p>Hi, my name is Martin and I live in Wakefield with my wife, daughter, son and a crazy cocker spaniel called Lola 
				(aka <em>Coca-Lola</em>). I have over 20 years of alarm / cctv / access experience with other skills such as general DIY, 
				Aerial & Satellite television but I'm currently a professional bus driver doing long shifts 4 days a week.<br><br>
				When I first heard of the Raspberry Pi I felt they were just for children but I soon found out that they was for all ages 
				and can be used in so many projects.<br><br>In 2015 I bought my first Raspberry Pi 2 and started using it as a media server using 
				Openelec. I wanted to do more with my Pi and so I bought another with some sensors and now I've got quite a collection.<br><br>
				In 2016 I started learning and creating python scripts to solve some problems for myself or others ie. Simple GPIO Timer Creator 
				script that I've included in my <a href="codes.html">codes</a> page.<br><br>In July 2018 I decided to purchase this domain and 
				started looking into HTML and CSS to code this site rather than using a template as I wouldn't learn anything from that. 
				Now that I have got this site up and running I will learn how to improve it by learning JavaScript.</p>
